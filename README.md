#ABSTRACT

The purpose of this essay is to examine how the computational complexity inherent to algorithms used
for different problems in computer science affects their running time, and in some cases accuracy,
along with it’s connections to technological challenges currently being tackled in today’s society.
We conduct a brief survey of key concepts related to the design of software algorithms and data
structures, test the performance of well-studied sorting and regression algorithms, and encourage
further reading via citations of books, journals and more. I chose this topic for my essay due to my
interest in mathematics, which eventually lead me into studying software engineering, computer
science and artificial intelligence on my free time, allowing me to now in addition to my school
studies also work part-time as a software developer at DigitalRoute AB since October 2018.
